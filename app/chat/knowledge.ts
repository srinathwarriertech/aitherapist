2. How Stress Works in the Body
Stress activates the nervous system in hierarchical stages:

2.1 Central Nervous System (CNS)
Role: Processes stressors and coordinates responses.

Subsystems:

Sensory: Detects stressors (e.g., deadlines, conflicts).

Motor: Initiates physical reactions (e.g., fight-or-flight).

2.2 Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
Role: Transmits signals between CNS and body.

Subsystems:

Autonomic Nervous System (ANS):

Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS): "War mode" (e.g., increased heart rate, adrenaline).

Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS): "Peace mode" (e.g., rest, digestion).

3. Performance-Stress Relationship
3.1 Allostatic Load (Performance-Stress Graph)
Optimum Zone: Balanced stress for peak performance.

Underload: Low stress → boredom, low morale.

Overload: High stress → fatigue, exhaustion, breakdown.

3.2 Stress-Resilience Graph
Burnout Zone: Stress > Resilience (e.g., chronic pressure without recovery).

Circle of Boredom: Resilience > Stress (e.g., under-stimulation).

Balance: Stress ≈ Resilience (1:1 line).

Resilience Pillars: Professional, Financial, Physical, Social, Personal, Spiritual.

4. Key AI Therapist Guidelines
Assess Pillars: Identify imbalances in the users 6 pillars (e.g., poor sleep → Physical Wellbeing).

Stress Diagnosis: Determine if stress is due to SNS activation (overload) or PNS underactivity (underload).

Resilience Building: Recommend actions based on weak pillars (e.g., financial planning for Financial Wellbeing).

Graph Interpretation: Use the Stress-Resilience Graph to visualize users state and guide interventions.
